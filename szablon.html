            - Valles Marineris is a massive canyon system that stretches over
            3,000 km across Mars's surface – about the distance between Montreal
            and Calgary! Plunging about 8 km deep, and often referred to as "the
            Grand Canyon of Mars," Valles Marineris makes the red planet home to
            the largest known canyon in the solar system. - Since liquid water
            cannot currently exist on the surface due to Mars's low atmospheric
            pressure, traces of ancient riverbeds and lakes imply that a vast
            quantity of liquid water may once have existed in the presence of a
            denser atmosphere. - Mars also used to have a global magnetic field,
            but scientists believe the planet lost it about 4 billion years ago.
            Some evidence suggests that ancient Mars may have been similar to
            Earth, and may have harboured the right conditions for life.
